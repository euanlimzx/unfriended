# Unfine Dining

In the show One Week Love, they play a game called Unfine Dining (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmzVrdrO9Z4)

The game involves asking each member of a group to answer some really tough questions suggested by the card pile.
I've always wanted to make a game similar to this, as I really enjoy "tough question" games similar to "We're Not Really Strangers".

Built in less than a day and released the day after this episode dropped, here is Unfine Dining, a Webapp created with React Native
